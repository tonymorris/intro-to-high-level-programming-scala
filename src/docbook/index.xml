<!--
* Introduce time at IBM on the IBM JDK (java.security) and IBM WAS 6, Functional Java and Reductio
(Automated Specification-based Verification and Testing)
* Check audience
  * Who attended the JAOO?
  * Who has some familiarity with foundational concepts such as higher-order functions?
* It is quite likely that we will not get to the end of these slides, but that is fine. You, the audience, will set the pace -
  these slides are excessively long, just in case you are all unexpectedly super-human.
* I am not here to bore you with slide after slide; you must engage your thinking faculties and ask me questions should they arise        
* functionaljava.org and reductiotest.org are written in Scala
